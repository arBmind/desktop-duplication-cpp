# Windows Desktop Duplication Tool

This is a nifty tool to host live coding in presentations.

You have your IDE and private notes on your main screen.
The tool only captures the code portion of this screen and shows it fullscreen on your presentation monitor or projector.

Personally I use this tool to host C++ usergroup meetings, client meetings and professional C++ trainings.


## Features

By top left part of the primary screen is duplicated to a window on the right part of the same screen.

Interactions:

* Move the window whereever you need it. Beamers for live coding and presentations.
* Double Left Mouseclick maximizes the window.
** The entire screen is now mirroring (no window frame)
** We prevent Windows from going to sleep mode in this presentation mode
* The Zoom also changes captured area.
** pass:[<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>Mousewheel ↕</kbd>/<kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd>] allows you to zoom
** pass:[<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>Mousewheel ↕</kbd>] zooms in smaller steps
** pass:[<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>0</kbd>] reset zoom to 1:1
* Moving the captured area.
** pass:[<kbd>Shift</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>Left Mouse Button</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>Dragging ⇔⇕</kbd>] allows you to move the visible portion
** pass:[<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd>/<kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>→</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd>] aligns the mirrored image to the border
* Move Window into captured area.
** pass:[2×<kbd>Right Mouse Button</kbd>] + [Focus other Window] will position and resize the other window into the mirrored area. Not all windows will like this.
* Interactions:
** Note: You can hover over the window icon in the taskbar and use the buttons there.
** pass:[<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Mouse Button</kbd>] toggle a visualisation of the captured area
** pass:[<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>] toggle pause. Freezes the image.

The tool is optimized to be very response and save CPU time.
