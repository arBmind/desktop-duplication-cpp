# Windows Desktop Duplication Tool

This is a little tool for live coding presentations.

I like to see the IDE on my laptop screen. But I don't want to duplicate the screen, so I can see my private notes.

I could not find such a tool, so I created this.


## Features

By default the primary screen is duplicated to a window.

Interactions:

* Move the window whereever you need it. Beamers for live coding and presentations.
* You can resize the window as you like. This changes the portion of the screen that is visible.
* Double Left Mouseclick maximizes the window.
* Maximized window looses the window frame. Ideal for presentations.
* pass:[<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>Mousewheel ↕</kbd>/<kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd>] allows you to zoom
* pass:[<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>Mousewheel ↕</kbd>] zooms in smaller steps
* pass:[<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>0</kbd>] reset zoom to 1:1
* pass:[<kbd>Shift</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>Left Mouse Button</kbd>] + pass:[<kbd>Dragging ⇔⇕</kbd>] allows you to move the visible portion
* pass:[2×<kbd>Right Mouse Button</kbd>] + [Focus other Window] will position and resize the other window into the mirrored area. Not all windows will like this.
* pass:[<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd>/<kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>→</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd>] aligns the mirrored image to the border
* pass:[<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Mouse Button</kbd>] toggle a visualisation of the captured area
* pass:[<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>] toggle pause. Freezes the image.

The tool is optimized to be very response and save CPU time.
